I enjoy building web applications and working on personal software projects to expand my skill set and apply the knowledge gained through my degree to real-world scenarios. This hands-on experience allows me to continually enhance my problem-solving abilities, stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, and further develop my technical expertise.
